1. Weight is a scalar quantity.
2. Speed is a scalar quantity.
3. Relative direction e.g. a displacement is a vector quantity.
4. At face value, both these values are scalar quantities. But considering the
implied direction and relative altitude, both of these can be interpreted as
vector quantities (600mph east, 33,000ft up)
