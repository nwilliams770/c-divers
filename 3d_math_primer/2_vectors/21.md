Using the dot product and we magnitudes of the two aforementioned vectors in problem 20,
we can solve for the cos(θ) where θ is the angle between the two vectors.

Once we have that value, we can compare it to the cosine of the NPC's field of vision
(90 degrees) divided by two. If cos(θ) is GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO the cos(FOV/2), that
means θ <= FOV/2 and the point is in the field of vision of the NPC.

cos(θ) = v • (x - p) / ||v||||x - p||

2.

Field of vision = 90 degrees
cos(field of vision / 2) = 0.707

a. x = [0 0]
23 / sqrt(29)sqrt(25) = 0.854

x is in the field of vision of the NPC.

b. x = [1 6]
16 / sqrt(29)sqrt(20) = 0.664

x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

c. x = [-6 0]
-7 / sqrt(29)sqrt(25) = -0.260

x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

d. x = [-4 7]
-11 / sqrt(29)sqrt(10) = -0.646

x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

e. x = [5 5]
38 / sqrt(29)sqrt(65) = 0.875

x is in the field of vision of the NPC.

f. x = [-3 0]
8 / sqrt(29)sqrt(16) = 0.371

x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

g. x = [-6 3.5]
0 / sqrt(29)sqrt(65.25) = 0

x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

3.

We must check if the distance between directional vector from the point to the
position of the NPC has a magnitude less than 7.

a. x = [0 0]
||[3 -4]|| = sqrt(25) < 7

x is visible to the NPC.

b. x = [1 6]
x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

c. x = [-6 0]
x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

d. x = [-4 7]
x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

e. x = [5 5]
||[8 1]|| = sqrt(65) > 7

x is not visible to the NPC.

f. x = [-3 0]
x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.

g. x = [-6 3.5]
x is not in the field of vision of the NPC.
