If we move vectors a and b such that the tails of each vector are at the origin,
we can measure the angle between the tip of each vector and the cardinal x-axis.
This angle is θa and θb, respectively, and the difference between these angles is
 θ which is the angle between the vectors.

sin = opp / hyp
cos = adj / hyp

θ =  θa -  θb

ax = ||a||cosθa
ay = ||a||sinθa

bx = ||b||cosθb
by = ||b||sinθb

a • b = axbx + ayby
a • b = ||a||cosθa||b||cosθb + ||a||sinθa||b||sinθb
a • b = ||a||||b||(cosθacosθb + sinθasinθb)

a • b = ||a||||b||(cos(θa - θb))
a • b = ||a||||b||(cosθ)
