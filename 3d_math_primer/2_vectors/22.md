1.

First we can generate two vectors: from a to b (vab) and from b to c (vbc).
As noted, these vectors are only in the xz-plane so the vectors will be
vab = [xab, 0, zab], vbc = [xbc, 0, zbc].

The cross-product, vab x vbc, will be [0 xbc*zab - xab*zbc 0] and this coordinate
will inform us about whether a is the left or right of b and whether the NPC will
turnclockwise or counterclockwise.

a. a = [2 0 3], b = [-1 0 5], c = [-4 0 1]
vab = [-3 0 2], vbc = [-3 0 -4]

vab x vbc = - 18 < 0. NPC turning counterclockwise.

b. a = [-3 0 -5], b = [4 0 0], c = [3 0 3]
vab = [7 0 5], vbc = [-1 0 3]

vab x vbc = -26 < 0. NPC turning counterclockwise.

c. a = [1 0 4], b = [7 0 -1], c = [-5 0 -6]
vab = [6 0 -5], vbc = [-12 0 -5]

vab x vbc = 90 > 0. NPC turning clockwise.

d. a = [-2 0 1], b = [1 0 2], c = [4 0 4]
vab = [3 0 1], vbc = [3 0 2]

vab x vbc = -3 < 0. NPC turning counterclockwise.
