Note: aM = b implies that the basis vectors are represented as [1 0] and [0 1]
(representing them as columns would mean aM = b is undefined and instead would
have to be Ma = b).

a. The transformation matrix describes a 90 degree rotation clockwise b The
transformation matrix describes a 45 degree counterclockwise rotation c. The
transformation matrix describes a 2x scale on the x and y dimensions d. The
transformation matrix describes a 4x scale on the x dimension and a 7x scale on
the y dimension e. The transformation matrix describes a reflection across the
y-axis (all x values inverted and y values remain unchanged) f. The
transformation matrix describes a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees and 2x scale
on the x and y dimensions
