A.
Unprotected code:
v and buf are at offsets -8 and -20 relative to %ebp

protected code:
Canary is stored at offset -8 and v and buf are at offsets -24 and -20.

B.
In protected code, v is positioned closer to the top of the stack than buf, so
a buf overflow will not corrupt v; buf is positioned so that any overrun will corrupt
canary value.
