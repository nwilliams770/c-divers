A.
cmpl %eax, %edx
setl %al
Comparison is for a 32-bit operand and comparison is for two's complement.
We can infer the type is int

B.
cmpw %ax, %dx
setge %al
Comparison is for a 16-bit operand and the comparison is for two's complement.
We can infer the type is short

C.
cmpb %al, %dl
setb %al
Comparison is for a 8-bit operand and comparison is for unsigned.
We can infer the type is unsigned char.

D.
cmpl %eax, %edx
setne %al
Comparison is for a 32-bit operand and comparison is for signed and unsigned.
We can infer the type can be int, unsigned, or a pointer. Can also be any of the
long types.
