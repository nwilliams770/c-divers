A.
| Field | Size | Offset |
|---|---|---|
| a | 4 | 0 |
| b | 2 | 4 |
| c | 8 | 8 |
| d | 1 | 16 |
| e | 4 | 20 |
| f | 1 | 24 |
| g | 8 | 32 |
| h | 4 | 40 |

B.
Total is 48 bytes long. End of structure must be padded by 4 bytes to satisfy
8-byte alignment requirement

C.
When all data els have a length equal to a power of two, is to order
the structure elements in descending order of size.
Total in this case is 32 bytes.

```
struct {
  double c;
  long long g;
  char *a;
  void *h;
  short b;
  char d;
  char f;
} foo;
