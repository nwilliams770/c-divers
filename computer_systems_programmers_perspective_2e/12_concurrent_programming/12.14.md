A. By passing `i` directly to each thread, each thread is provided its own copy
of `i` as opposed to a pointer. When passing a pointer, each thread will receive
the same memory address (the compiler is not copying i and then creating a new
pointer to it)

B. An advantage is not having the overhead of calling `malloc()` and `free()`
but a large disadvantage here is this code assumes pointers are the same size if
not larger than ints. This is true is most cases but consider a system where
pointers are 16 bits and ints are 32 bits. When copying the bits of the int to
the pointer, information will be lost, leading to unexpected behavior and
results
