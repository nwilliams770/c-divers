The `command()` function will be invoked. Breakdown is below:

- `main()` is blocked when `select` is called; it is waiting for activity
on the file descriptors it monitors
- Ctrl+D signals EOF on standard input (`STDIN_FILENO`)
- `select` returns, indicating that the fd stdin is ready for reading
- program checks if stdin is in the set of ready descriptors (`FD_ISSET(STDIN_FILENO, &ready_set)`)
- program then calls `command()`
- program continues with next iteration of the loop
