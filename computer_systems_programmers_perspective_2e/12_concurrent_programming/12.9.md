A. p = 1, c = 1, n > 1
Yes, the mutex semaphore is necessary because both producer and consumer can
concurrently access the buffer.

B. p = 1, c = 1, n = 1
No. In this case a non-empty buffer is a full buffer. When full, the producer
is blocked and when empty, the consumer is blocked. Given this, one a single
thread can access the buffer at a given time and mutual exclusion is guaranteed
without the mutex.

C. p > 1, c > 1, n = 1
No, for the reasons mentioned in case B.
