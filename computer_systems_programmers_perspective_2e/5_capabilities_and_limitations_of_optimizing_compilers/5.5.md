A.
2n multiplication operations and n addition operations

B.
Limiting factor is the continual computation of `xpwr` which is double-precision
multiplication (5 clock cycles). Computing `result` requires 3 clock cycles and
both operations per iteration cannot start until the previous iteration has been
computed.
