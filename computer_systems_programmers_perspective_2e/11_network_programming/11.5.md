1. Automatic Cleanup of File Descriptors:

- When a CGI program completes its execution, the child process exits, and the kernel automatically closes all associated file descriptors.
- This includes the file descriptor representing the client connection, ensuring proper cleanup.

2. dup2 for Redirecting Standard Output:

- Before the CGI program runs, the web server uses dup2 to redirect the standard output (stdout) of the CGI process to the file descriptor associated with the client connection.
- This redirection ensures that anything written to stdout by the CGI program is sent directly to the client.

3. Connection to the Client:

- The client connection is essentially represented by a file descriptor, and the kernel manages this file descriptor.
- The kernel automatically closes the file descriptor associated with the client connection when the CGI process terminates.
