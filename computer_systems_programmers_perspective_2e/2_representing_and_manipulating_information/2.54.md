x, int; f, float; d, double;
A. x == (int)(double) x
Yes, double has greater precision than int
B. x == (int)(float) x
No, if x is TMax, casting to float would overflow
C. d == (double)(float) d
No, double has great precision so when casting to float we may overflow
D. f == (float)(double) f
Yes, double has greater precision than float
E. f == -(-f)
Yes, floats are converted to positive/negative by toggling the single sign bit
F. 1.0/2 == 1/2.0
Yes, numerators and denominators will both be casted to floats before operation is performed
G. d*d >= 0.0
Yes, although may overflow to infinity (does not wrap around like floats)
H. (f+d)-f == d
No
