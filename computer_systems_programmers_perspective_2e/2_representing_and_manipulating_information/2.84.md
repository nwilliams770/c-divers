Given floating point format with a k-bit exponent and n-bit fraction, write formulas for the exponent E, significand M, fraction f and value V. In addition describe the bit representation.

A. 7.0
E = 2, M = 1.11, f = 0.11, and V = 7. Exponent bits will be 100...01 and fraction bits
will be 110....0

B. The largest odd integer that can be represented exactly
Will have a binary representation of n+1 ones. E = n, M = 1.11...1, f = 0.11..1

C. The reciprocal of the smallest positive normalized value
