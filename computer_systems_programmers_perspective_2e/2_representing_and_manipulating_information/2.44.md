A. (x > 0) || (x - 1 < 0)
False. This will eval to false if x is TMin32. TMin32 - 1 = TMax

B. (x & 7) != 7 || (x<<29 < 0)
True. Any x & 7 will not eval to 7 except 7. 7 (0b111) << 29 will be negative.

C. (x *x) >= 0
False. If x* x has the potential to overflow where it will be < 0.

D. x < 0 || -x <= 0
False. Is x is negative, -x will always be positive. And if x is nonnegative,
-x will always be nonpositive

E. x > 0 || -x >= 0
False. If x is TMin32, then both x and -x are negative.

F. x+y == uy+ux
True. When comparing signed and unsigned values, compiler will cast the signed
value to unsigned. The bit patterns are the same and after casting, values will
be the same.

G. x*~y + uy*ux == -x
True.
