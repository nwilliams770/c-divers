Intel-compatible processors support "extended precision" floats with an 80-bit word where k = 15 exponent bits, a single integer bit and n=63 fraction bits. Integer bit is explicit copy of the implied bit in the IEEE representation that it equal 1 for normalized values
and 0 for denormalized values

| Description | Value | Decimal |
|---|---|---|
| Smallest positive denormalized | 2^-63 * 2^-16382 | 3.64 * 10^-4951 |
| Smallest positive normalized | 2^-16382 | 3.36 * 10^-4932 |
| Largest normalized | (2 - E) * 2^16383 | 1.19 * 10^4932 |
