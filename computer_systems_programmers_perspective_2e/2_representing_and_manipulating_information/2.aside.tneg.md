A. Resulting data type would be int and value would be TMin32 as we'd have positive
overflow. Casting to int would have no effect.
B. Same result as A; that is hex representation of TMax so compiler would treat it as
an int.
C. 2147483649 is over TMax32 so compiler would treat it as a long long an expression
would eval to 2147483648. Casting to int would remove 32 leading bits and result in
TMin32.
D. This hex number is -2,147,483,647 in (two's complement) decimal so subtracting
one would eval to TMin32, type would be int. Casting to int would have no effect.
E. Hex number is 2147483648. Too large to represent as int so compiler would treat
it as unsigned. Negating this would yield -2147483648 and casting to int would
result in TMin32.
