A. Let V denote the value of the string. If we shift the binary point k positions
to the right, giving a string y.yyy..., it will have a numeric value of Y (the number with the binary representation of y) + V. It will ALSO have the value V * 2^k (shifting the binary point to the right is the equivalent of multiplying by 2, shifting to left dividing by 2).

Y + V = V * 2**k => V = Y / (2^k - 1)

B.
  a. y = 101
  Y = 5, k = 3, V = 5 / 7
  b. y = 0110
  Y = 6, k = 4, V = 6 / 15
  c. y = 010011
  Y = 19, k = 6, V = 19 / 64
