1. No this improvement does not help at all. Event if we are able to prevent the overflow, the argument for malloc is of type size_t (unsigned int) so the same overflow conditions can occur.

2. Argument ele_count should be of type size_t; there's use-case in which this argument should be negative. Furthermore, the total number of bytes should be pre-calculated and if they are more than what malloc can allocate, the function should return NULL.
