int are 32 bits, two's complement, right shifted arithmetically
unsigned are also 32 bits

int x = rand();
int y = rand();

unsigned ux = (unsigned) x;
unsigned uy = (unsigned) y;

Determine if statements will always yield 1
A. (x < y) == (-x > -y)
No, if x=0 and y=TMin32

B. ((x + y) << 4) + y - x == 17y + 15x
Yes, due to ring properties of two's complement arithmetic.

C. ~x + ~y + 1 == ~(x + y)
Yes

D. (ux - uy) == (unsigned) (y - x)
Yes

E. ((x >> 2) << 2) <= x
Yes, right shifts round towards minus infinity.
