a. Output is `5`. Converting `short` to `int` is numeric promotion while converting to `double` is numeric conversion. The compiler will favor option that is numeric promotion over conversion
b. Parameters with default arguments aren't counted when resolving overloaded functions; compiler can't tell to resolve `print()` to `print()` or `print(x=0)`
c. `int` can be converted to `long` or `double` so the compiler cannot determine which function is a better match
