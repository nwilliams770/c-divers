1a. Neither Base nor Derived describe `getName()` as a virtual function or override.

1b.Whereas Derived describes its method as `const`, Base does not. The difference
in these function signatures means that, although virtual functions, `Base::getName()`
will never resolve to `Derived::getName()`

1c. d, Derived, was assigned to b, Base, by value. This causes d to get sliced.

1d. Base was declared as final so Derived cannot be derived from it.

1e. Derived `getName()` is a pure virtual function (with a body), making Derived an
abstract class that cannot be directly instantiated.

1f. Virtual destructors are not defined so when the Base pointer to the Derived object
is deleted, only the Base portion is deleted. Derived portion is never deleted and
memory is leaked.
